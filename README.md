ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; OPTIMIZATION IN  MANUFACTURING PROCESSES USING MACHINE LEARNING
This repository includes the overview of the research conducted in the field of energy efficiency optimization using machine learning. Machine learning, with its ability to analyse vast datasets and extract valuable insights, has emerged as a promising tool in this domain. We commence by surveying the current challenges faced in manufacturing, including rising energy costs and the imperative to reduce environmental impact. It underscores the growing need for innovative strategies to optimize energy usage and productivity. The application of machine learning models and algorithms to manufacturing processes is explored, with a particular emphasis on data collection and analysis. The results showcase the capacity of machine learning to predict, adapt, and enhance energy consumption while simultaneously optimizing production processes. The findings affirm that machine learning is a powerful tool to facilitate real-time decision-making and reduce energy wastage in manufacturing.![image](https://github.com/Xlaton25/ENERGY-EFFICIENCY-OPTIMIZATION-IN-MANUFACTURING-PROCESSES-EDM-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING/assets/102571572/fef894ed-0418-4618-b63b-9a18b8e7cfab)
